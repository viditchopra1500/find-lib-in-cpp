 A C++ library that searches a given directory for a file. The directory may have nested sub-directories which contains the file. It returns the location of the file. If there are multiple files with the same name, the lib returns every fileâ€™s location.
 
To use it first->
1)#include the library in your file.

Then to link the library to your file run the following command in terminal to create the executable file->

2)g++ {relative lib path from your file} {your filename} -o {your executable file}

eg-> for the file in the testing folder linking looked like this->
g++ ./../lib/find.cpp use.cpp -o use

After following above steps a executable file will be formed with the same name as your file to run the file use->

```
./use
Give file to search: todo
Give relative path from this file of the directory you want to search the file in: ./..
The relative path for the file you wanted to search from the current directory
./../todo-api/todo.
./../todo-api/files/todo.
```
